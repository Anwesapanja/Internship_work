📊 Data Analysis Internship Project – Cognifyz Technologies
This repository showcases the work completed during my Data Analysis Internship at Cognifyz Technologies, a company specializing in AI, machine learning, and advanced data analytics. The internship provided a comprehensive, multi-level experience in analyzing real-world datasets to uncover actionable insights using Power BI and Python.

🧠 Project Overview
The tasks were divided across three levels (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3), each containing problem statements that reflect practical business scenarios in the food and restaurant industry. These tasks aimed to strengthen my analytical thinking, visualization skills, and ability to derive meaningful conclusions from data.

🔍 Key Tasks Completed
Level 1: Foundational Data Analysis

Identified the top cuisines by frequency and calculated their percentage share.

Conducted city-wise analysis to determine restaurant distribution and average ratings.

Visualized price range distributions across restaurants using bar charts.

Compared ratings between restaurants that offer online delivery and those that don't.

Level 2: Intermediate Analytical Techniques

Explored the most common cuisine combinations and their correlation with higher ratings.

Performed geographical analysis using latitude and longitude to detect location-based restaurant clusters.

Investigated the presence and performance of restaurant chains in the dataset.

Level 3: Advanced Data Interpretation

Identified restaurants with the highest and lowest votes and examined the correlation between votes and ratings.

Analyzed how price range relates to services like online delivery and table booking.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI Desktop for interactive dashboards and visual analysis.

Python (Pandas, NumPy) for basic data handling and preprocessing.

Data visualization techniques including histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and maps.

📈 Outcome
This internship allowed me to:

Build end-to-end data analysis pipelines

Develop meaningful data stories and dashboards

Improve decision-making through data visualization

Apply analytical skills in a business-centric environment
